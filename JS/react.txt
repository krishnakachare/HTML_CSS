1. Code Splitting: Break down large bundles into smaller chunks to reduce initial load times
2. Lazy Loading: Load non-essential components\asynchronously to prioritize critical content.
3. Caching and Memoization: Cache data locally or use memoization libraries to avoid redundant API calls and computations.
4. Memoization: Memoize expensive computations and avoid unnecessary re-renders using tools like React.memo and useMemo.
5. Optimized Rendering: Use shouldComponentUpdate, PureComponent, or React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders of components.
6. Virtualization: Implement virtual lists and grids to render only the visible elements, improving rendering performance for large datasets.
7. Server-Side Rendering (SSR): Pre-render content on the server to improve initial page load times and enhance SEO.
8. Bundle Analysis: Identify and remove unused dependencies, optimize images, and minify code to reduce bundle size.
9. Performance Monitoring: Continuously monitor app performance using tools like Lighthouse, Web Vitals, and browser DevTools.
10. Optimize rendering with keys: - Ensure each list item in a mapped array has a unique and stable key prop to optimize rendering performance. Keys help React identify which items have changed, been added, or removed, minimizing unnecessary DOM updates.
11. CDN Integration: Serve static assets and resources from Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) to reduce latency and improve reliability.
