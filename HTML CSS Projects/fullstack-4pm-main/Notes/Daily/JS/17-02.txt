Arrays:
Arrays are used to collect different Items
It is a non- primitive data type
what is the main difference between primitive and non-primitive data types?
primitive data types- immutable and compares value
non-primitive data type- mutable and compares reference

Array Methods:
length- length will return number of Items
indexOf- return first index of the value
lastIndexOf- return the last Index Of the value
includes- return true if value exists in the Array
push- used to push the values into the array at end of the array
unshift - used to push the values into the array at the start of the array
pop- to remove the last element of array
shift- to remove first element of the array
splice(startElement,deleteCount,addingElement)- use it to delete /add anywhere in array
copywithin- used to copy the elements within the array
find- it will take callback function and return the first value which matches the specified condition in callback function
findIndex- it will take callback function and return the first value Index which matches the specified condition in callback function
every- it will take callback function and return the true if all array values matches the specified condition in callback function
forEach- it will take callback function and it will return undefined. it is used to check the element in the array and perform some actions.
map - it will take a callback function and it will return new array which goes through the logic mentioned in callback function but it return all values.
filter- it works exactly like map which is used to return only true cases
reduce()- it takes a callback fn with two values(previous,present) and it also takes a value for present and it returns based on logic

Objects:
objects are used to define the values with key, value pair within {}

you can define normal data or even functions
