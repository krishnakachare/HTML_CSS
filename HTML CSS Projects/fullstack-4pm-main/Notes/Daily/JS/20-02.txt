Loops:
loops are iterators which repeats a set/block of code again and again, each repeatation is called iteration
There are two type of loops
Entry control loops and entry control loops
Entry control loops:
popular js entry control loops are while and for
each loops needs three values initialization,condition,updation

//while loops
initialization;
while(condition)
{
    //statements
    updation;
}
the while loop will iterate until condition becomes false.
Eg: //use while loop to print elements of the following array
let arr=[3,4,5,6,9]
let i=0;
while(i<arr.length)
{
    console.log(arr[i])
    i++;
}
//for loop
for will take initialization,condition and updation in single line
for(initialization;consition;updation){
    //statements
}
for(let i=0;i<arr.length;i++)
{
    console.log(arr[i])
}
//There are two variations of for in js
1.for..of which is used to iterate through the array
/* arr=["raj","xyz","avc"]
for(let v of arr)
{
    console.log(v)
}
here v comes as values in array
2. it ususally uses for objects but in case of arrays here each value represent index
for(let v in arr)
{
  console.log(v)
}
here v is index.

Exit control loop:
do-while will check the condition  at the end of the loop
initialize;
do{
    //statements
}while(condition);
