Asynchronous JS:
Javascript is a single threaded synchronous language
Asynchronous means which will take some time

we have so many default asynchronous functions
like fetch(),timers or async-await etc..,
Timers: timer is a web api which have default methods like setTimeout(),setInterval().
setTimeout --> it will run only once after specific time
setInterval()--> it will run for even span of specific time

How Asynchronous function run. JS is synchronous and single threaded language. all async functions are pushed into task queue. then event loop pushes the task queue elements into callstack when call stack is empty.

API: application programming interface
