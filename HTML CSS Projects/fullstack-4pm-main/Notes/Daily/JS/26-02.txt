Events:
Each event is a ction done by user or system, it triggers a particular function for a purpose. one event may trigger multiple functions.Events are declared in two ways,
1. Event handlers:
you will declare the events in HTML and define its action in JS
sometimes events may way and get trigger,for that we use event listners
2. Event Listners: we will declare and define event in JS.
you can select the element in js and addEventListner to it.
There are mainly three types of events:
1. window events: eg:onload,onDOMContentloaded.on abort etc..,
2. mouseEvents: eg:onclick,ondblclick,onmouseover,onmouseout etc..,
3.keyboard events:eg:keyup,keypress,keydown

How events are propograted?

capturing(top down approach) and bubbling(bottom up approach)

create the counter app using addEventListner


Event Delegation: it is design pattern which suggests calling parent element once instead of calling each element
