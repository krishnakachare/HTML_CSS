API: API's are used to bring the data or send the data or update the data;
In olden times API requests used to be done by using XmlHttpRequest.
Modern Methods are fetch(a default method in browser) and axios(3rd party application to send or receive data requests).
API are two types:
1. REST API-->state transmission-->  data gets updated with its state-->data is in the format of JSON
JSON(Javascript object notation)---> stringified version ob objects/data
2. graphQL



How Fetch Works?
fetch(url), it will return a promise
PROMISE: a promise is an object which describes an eventual completion of async operation.
we can resolve promises by .then and
we can resolve errors in promises by catch

but catch will work only if then satement is above it
