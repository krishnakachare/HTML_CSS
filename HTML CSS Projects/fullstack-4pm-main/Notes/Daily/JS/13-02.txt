 ii.string
 iii.boolean

 Note: To know type of data , use 'typeof' operator

 Explain number methods:
var a = 23;
var c = 25252552525;
console.log(a, typeof a);

//Default Number Methods
var b=23.689
console.log(b.toFixed(1))
console.log(b.toPrecision(3))
console.log(c.toString(16))
var d = 16;
//23 number
//numbers also have default methods called Math methods.
console.log(Math.sqrt(d), Math.cbrt(d), Math.abs(-10), Math.pow(d, 2), d * d, d ** 2, Math.max(a, b), Math.min(a, b));

var k = -3.4;
console.log(Math.round(k), Math.floor(k), Math.ceil(k))
//get a random value,Math.random will give random values between 0.0 to 1.0
console.log(Math.round(Math.random()*10000))

Task1:
 Take 2 inputs and print its max,min as integers only and generate 6 digit OTP and print them

 // var a= Number(prompt("enter a value));
 // var a= Number(prompt("enter a value));
 Math.round(Math.min(a,b)),Math.round(Math.max(a,b)),Math.round(Math.random()*1000000)

 Pro Tip:To convert a string into number, you can use unary operator + before the value
