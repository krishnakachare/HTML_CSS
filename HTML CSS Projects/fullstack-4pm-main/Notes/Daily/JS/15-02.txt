//operators
k= a + b ==> a and b are called operands, + is called operator, a+b is called operation/expression;
operators are three types
1. Unary Operators: these operators are used for only one operand
Eg: unary +, unary -  ++(increment), --(decrement)
Increment and decrement Operators
Increment operator is used to increase the value by 1 and decrement operator is used to decrease the value by 1
// there are two way increment or decrement happens, one is pre increment another is post increment
//++a is pre increment, a++ is post--> pre increment first update the value and returns, post increment first returns the value and updates.
//pre and post decrement also works similar but they decrease the value by 1
2. Binary Operators: Binary Operators need atleast two operands

  Arithematic operators: +, - , * ,/ , %, **
  Relational Operators: Relational operators are used to compare the values and return boolean value
  > , < , >=,<=, ==,===,!=,!==
  what is the difference b/w == and ===
  == compares only value , === compares data type and value
  Logical Operator:
  these operator are used to combined statements/conditions
  &&(logical AND), ||(Logical OR), !(Logical NOT)
  " ravi is  good guy or he loves programming"
  ((5>2)&&(5<10)) => T && T==>T
   ((5<2)||(5<10)) => F || T==> T
   !(5>2) ==>!T= false
   Assignment or shorthand operators:

   3. Ternary Operator:
   It needs atleast 3 operands 
   value= condition ? exp1 :exp2 ;
   special operators: typeof is a operator used to check the data types
   nullish coelsion operator(??)

FUNCTIONS
###################################################################

Function is used to do a particular task. these are used for repetitive purposes.

syntax: 
function function-name(parameters--optional)
{

}
//block means open brace to close brace
eg:function something ()
{
    console.log("something")
}
something()
Task: write a function sum--> take two values inside sum and alert their sum and call the function
task2: write functions sum,sub,mul,div for respective operations with two parameters, return their values and print them
task3: write a function which accepts a string and a number and returns the character of that number in string
Input:"My name is Prasad",4
Output:n
Input2:"PRASAD",3
Output:A
task4: write a function to accept a number as radius and return area of circle.(HInt: area of circle is pi r square)
