We have learned selections,pseudo classes,pseudo elements
backgrounds,colors,texts

Box-Model: it contains Padding+border+margin
padding: space between content and border  => padding: 60px/* top.left.right.bootom=60px*/ or padding-top/padding-right/padding-bottom/padding-left or padding:tb lr or t r l b
Border:extreme end of the Box  border: width type color
margin:space between two boxes/ space contained by the box outside the border

Box-sizing: by default you have content box
by making it "border box" padding,border will be included in the box height and width

display: none will remove from the DOM,visibility:none will just hide in the UI
display:block/inline will make element as block or inline but inline elements cannot have height/width. To solve that you can give display:inline-block

float:left/right will move the element to left /right side of the page, but it removed from the normal flow of page. to clear it sides we use 'clear' property

units:
px- pixels your screen having width*height some pixels
%- you can use % also for difference percentages of parent
em- emphasized text , it measures based on parent 1.5em means 1.5 times the parent size
rem- root emphasized text, it measures based on root element 1rem is 16px
vh and vw are viewport height and view port width which works like percentage of view port(what visible on screen)
