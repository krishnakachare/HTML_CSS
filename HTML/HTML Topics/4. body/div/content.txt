The div tag in HTML is known as the division tag. The div tag is applied to HTML documents to create content segmentation in a web page, such as images, text, headers, footers, navigation bars, etc. The <div> tag contains both an opening and a closing tag. Since the HTML <div> tag helps users create different data blocks to represent different contexts, it is the most commonly used tag in web development.

HTML provides various tags for different purposes of creating web pages. The <div> tag can be used instead of most all block-level tags and is not affecting the context of the layout of the HTML document. Since the <div> tag is a block-level element, it starts on a new line. The use of this HTML tag reduces the program's complexity for the web designer. Therefore, it is advisable to use div tags.


# An example of an HTML div element:

        <div class="card-body">
            <h2>This is a title inside the div element</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Identifiers</li>
                <li>Keywords</li>
                <li>Constants</li>
                <li>Strings</li>
                <li>Operators</li>
                <li>Special Symbols</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
