props: props are the short form of properties.
whenever parent component instantiate the child component, it also passes some properties in the form of object(key,value pairs)
for example
//parent.jsx
<child x="value" y="value2" />
then child component receives props object with x,y as keys and value,value2 as their respective values
props={
    x:value,
    y:value2
}



1. Destructuring: you can destructure an object in the Child components
eg: const {x,y} = props;
