Introduction to Routing in React:

Why routing is important in single-page applications (SPAs).
Overview of React Router and its benefits.
Setting Up React Router:

Installing React Router using npm or yarn.
Basic configuration of BrowserRouter.
Route Rendering:

Using the <Route> component to render components based on URL paths.
Defining routes with different paths.
Handling route parameters and dynamic routing.
Navigating Between Routes:

Using the <Link> component for navigation.
Programmatically navigating with the history object.
Creating navigation menus and links.
Exact Matching and Switch:

Understanding the exact prop in routes.
Using the <Switch> component for exclusive route rendering.
Nested Routes:

Creating nested route hierarchies.
Rendering child components within parent components.
Handling route parameters in nested routes.
Redirects:

Using the <Redirect> component for route redirection.
Conditional redirects based on user actions or authentication.
Route Guards and Authentication:

Implementing route guards to protect certain routes.
Checking user authentication before allowing access.
404 Handling:

Creating a custom 404 page for unknown routes.
Redirecting to the 404 page for unmatched routes.
Query Parameters:

Handling query parameters in URLs.
Accessing and manipulating query parameters in components.
Route Transition Effects:

Implementing route transition animations.
Using libraries like React Transition Group for animations.
Route Configuration with Route Arrays:

Defining routes using an array of route objects.
Dynamic route generation based on data.
Lazy Loading and Code Splitting:

Lazy loading components for better performance.
Implementing code splitting for smaller bundle sizes.
HashRouter vs. BrowserRouter:

Understanding the difference between hash-based and history-based routing.
Use cases for each router type.
Route Testing and Debugging:

Testing routes and components with React Router.
Debugging common routing issues.
Advanced Topics (Optional):

Advanced route matching with Regular Expressions.
Server-side rendering (SSR) with React Router.
Integrating third-party libraries and components with React Router.
Best Practices and Performance Optimization:

Best practices for structuring your routes.
Tips for optimizing route handling and navigation performance.
Real-World Applications:

Building real-world applications that demonstrate the usage of React Router in practical scenarios.
Security Considerations:

Addressing security concerns related to routing, such as route authentication and authorization.

react router  is 3rd party library used for routing in react application

browserrouter will be global container. each route is embraced in Route tag and all routes are embraced in Routes. a link will use Link tag.
For not found page we can use "*" as path.
