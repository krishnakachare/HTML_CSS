Hooks:
Hooks are the functions implemented in react 16.8 version. These hooks can replace LifeCycle Methods and can make programs more optimisized.
functional component are basically stateless and cannot have life cycle methods so we use hooks to bring state and life cycle methods into functional components
componentDidMount+componentDidUpdate==>useEffect.
Every hook in react starts with "use"
1.useState(): useState is used to update the value and render the component. it is called state
   const [value,fn]=useState(initialValue);
2. useEffect(): useEffect is used to handle sideEffects. sideEffect means anything which doesn't effect UI Directly.
useEffect(callbackfn,[dependencies])
if no dependencies array then useEffect will get triggered for every state change
if empty dependencies arrya, then useEffect will get triggereed for only one time(mount)
if any dependencies, then useEffect will get Triggered for Every State Change of that dependency.

useEffect runs after Paint is Done. After component render-->DOM constructed--->paint --->useEffect

useEffect will have some clearup logic which we can write after return in useEffect.

3. useContext():
useContext works as a consumer for content provider.
const {values}=useContext(contextname).
In context API we provide global values by contextname.provide values and we retrive the values by useContext
4. useRef(): useRef is used for references. mainly this is used for DOM manipulation.
for example
const inp= useRef();
<input type="text" ref={inp} />
In the above code , whenever user enters somevalue in input automatically dom updates that value into inp .  this type of components are called uncontrolled components.
5.useNaviage() & useParams()
6. useLayoutEffect: it is exactly similar to useEffect but only difference is useLayoutEffect will triggered before the Paint. immediate after the DOM.
We use it in the cases of DOM manipulative data
7.useMemo: it is used to memeorize expensive calculations.
it is used to memorize callback functions.
React.memo is Higher order component(it means it will take component and return component if input props are changed)
8.useCallback: useCallback is used to remember the callback function. it will triggered only if inputs of the functions are changed(dependencies updated)
9.useImpertiveHandle & forWardRef
10.useReducer & Redux
